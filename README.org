* An Open Source 8051 Emulator
  This open source project will emulate the behaviour of the Intel 8051 microcontroller.
  For the development of the project I used the a51 assembler which is also an opensource project on https://github.com/tmikov/a51.git
** Current State
   In the current state the emulator is expirimental and doesnt include register paging and 3 commands and they are: (RETI), (ORL /bit, C) and (ANL /bit, C)
** Compilation
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/peershaul/8051_emulator.git
cd 8051_emulator/emulator
make
   #+END_SRC
** Using the emulator
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd 8051_emulator/emulator
bulid/emulator "path to .bin or .hex file"
   #+END_SRC 
** If you want to contirbute and help feel free to do so
