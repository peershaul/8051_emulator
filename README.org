* An Open Source 8051 Emulator
  This open source project will emulate the behaviour of the Intel 8051 microcontroller.
  For the development of the project, I used the a51 assembler, which is also an opensource project on https://github.com/tmikov/a51.git
** Current State
   In the current state, the emulator is experimental and doesn't include register paging, as well as 3 commands: (RETI), (ORL /bit, C) and (ANL /bit, C)
** Compilation
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/peershaul/8051_emulator.git
cd 8051_emulator/emulator
make
   #+END_SRC
** Using the Emulator
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd 8051_emulator/emulator
bulid/emulator "path to .bin or .hex file"
   #+END_SRC
